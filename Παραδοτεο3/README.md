Make sure to have your graphs uploaded to the google colab, then one at a time rename the graphs into --> graph.mtx and drag them into the sample_data file.
Run the import block first before anything to make sure all the appropriate materials are all set
Run the code block once,it will take a while,dw it is normal cause we have the creation of binary files for optimized run time.
The second run is the best!
When moving to the next graph to try, delete the binary files and rename the graph into graph.mtx!|
Have a good day!
